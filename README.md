# contraste
Contraste - Color scheme for Sublime Text 2/3 inspired by Sunburst, best for xml/html, php, javascript and css.

Changes from Sunburst:
    
    - The line numbers left gutter has now grey background
    - Fewer colors for less distraction
    - Fixes for php templates inside properties of html files
